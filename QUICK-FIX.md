# ðŸ”§ Rust Compilation Fix Applied

## Changes Made:
âœ… **Removed Pydantic** - caused Rust compilation errors
âœ… **Downgraded packages** to older versions without Rust dependencies:
  - fastapi: 0.95.0 (stable, no Rust)
  - uvicorn: 0.20.0 
  - httpx: 0.23.0
  - websockets: 10.4

âœ… **Simplified code** - removed BaseModel classes

## Deploy the Fix:

```bash
# 1. If you haven't added GitHub remote yet:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/round-taible-backend.git

# 2. Push the fix:
git push origin main
```

## In Render Dashboard:
1. Go to your service
2. Click **"Manual Deploy"** â†’ **"Deploy latest commit"**  
3. Build should now succeed! ðŸŽ‰

## Alternative: Manual Requirements
If it still fails, try this minimal requirements.txt:
```
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.20.0
requests==2.28.0
websockets==10.4
```

The issue was newer FastAPI versions requiring Rust-compiled dependencies. These older versions are stable and Render-compatible.
